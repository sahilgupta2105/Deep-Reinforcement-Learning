## Convolutional Autoencoder (Keras)

These scripts contain two different architecture for training convolutional autoencoders for encoding the fluid velocity field. The field is spread on a structured MAC grid and can be considered similar to an image data, where the 1st layer contains the x-component and 2nd layer the y-componenet. 

Keras is used to build the autoencoder with tensorflow as backend.
