# Hybrid Simulator

Imports gym environment for simulator and uses the trained agent for simulating the ball balancing game. 

Note: Although the trained agent may not be robust enough, multiple runs result in a successful episode. The reason for this being that the controller is not able to generalize well enough. I have tested and the agent is able to sustain 1000 steps and still doesn't loose control of the ball.
