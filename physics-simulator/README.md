# 2D Physics Simulator for coupled Rigid-Fluid motion

This folder contatins the code for a 2D simulator which simulates the coupled motion of a fluid and rigid ball. The method is based on this paper: Batty, C., Bertails, F., and Bridson, R. 2007. A Fast Variational Framework for Accurate Solid-Fluid Coupling. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 26(3), (Proceedings of SIGGRAPH 2007).
